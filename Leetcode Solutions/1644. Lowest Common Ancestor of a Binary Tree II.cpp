Desc : Find LCA if p or q doesn't exist in a tree?

Ques to ask :
    - If p/q both are NULL?

Sol :
=> Inorder Traversal & storing path in vector - [TIME - O(N) SPACE - O(H)]
    - Store path from Root node to P / Q node in a vector using inorder 
    traversal.
    - Compare both vector & return the last common node found in both 
    vector

BEST APPROACH
=> Finding node in subtree - [TIME - O(2*N) SPACE - O(N) -> stack size]
    - Firstly, we'll check if p or q are present in tree or not.
    - Instead of storing path in vector, we can simply check if both the 
    P / Q nodes are found in different / same subtree of root node.
    - If found in different subtree or root is P/Q node, then return root.
    - If found in same subtree then reduce search space to that subtree only, 
    and repeat step 2.

    - What will happen if we want to find LCA for q queries?
        -> store the parent of every node in the tree and then find the 
        LCA in O(H) time, didnâ€™t have the time to code it.
